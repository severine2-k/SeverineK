# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)

library(ggplot2)

# Read the dataset
health_data <- read_csv("healthcare data.csv")

# Prepare data for plotting
case_data <- health_data %>%
  group_by(race, ethnicity) %>%
  summarise(flu_cases = sum(flu_2022), covid_cases = sum(covid), .groups = 'drop')

# Plotting the data
ggplot(case_data, aes(x = race, y = flu_cases, fill = ethnicity)) +

  facet_wrap(~ethnicity, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Flu and COVID-19 Cases by Race and Ethnicity",

       y = "Number of Cases",

I visualize the distribution of flu and COVID-19 cases across different races and ethnicities, and see how healthcare services were utilized by these groups. This analysis might provide insights into healthcare accessibility or outreach effectiveness during the pandemic.

This approach provides two separate plots:

Flu Cases:

Displays the number of flu cases recorded in the dataset for each race, divided by ethnicity.

COVID-19 Cases:

Similar to the flu cases plot but for COVID-19.

These visualizations can help identify disparities in healthcare coverage or disease impact among different demographic groups, highlighting areas where healthcare interventions might need to be focused.
