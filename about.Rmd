 Hello! I'm a licensed nurse currently advancing my expertise with a Master of Science in Health Data Analytics. My journey in healthcare is driven by a passion to integrate clinical knowledge with data-driven insights, aiming to improve patient outcomes and healthcare efficiencies.

Beyond my professional life, I have a deep appreciation for the finer things in life like fashion, photography, and the joy of experiencing new things. I believe in living life to the fullest and finding beauty in everyday moments.

Family and faith are central to my life. Residing in Ayer with my loved ones and drawing strength from my faith in God, I find balance and inspiration in both my personal and professional endeavors.

Whether through my academic pursuits or when capturing lifeâ€™s beauty through a camera lens, I strive to bring passion and precision to everything I do. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities that blend my healthcare expertise with my love for data and aesthetics.
